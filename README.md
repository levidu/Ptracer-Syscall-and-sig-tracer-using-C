**Important notes to run our ptracer** 
   Due to hardships to make the program with the specified format, we used our own format to make the program run with errors. Please use the following command to run our ptracer in project-13: ptracer command [args] [-h] [-f file] 

**Expected outcomes of System calls**
  We have managed to complete 10/15 system calls.
  
|syscall# |syscall|result|
|---------|-------|------|
|0|read|Managed to gather all the actual values for its arguments|
|1|write|Managed to gather all the actual values for its arguments. However, we also get the stdout result. We assume that we failed to pokedata and retrieve it as an empty string|
